# Task #30 Introduction to Selenium WebDriver

Selenium WebDriver is based on 3 essentials. Implementation of WebDriver interface starts a real browser and provides us ability â€‹to communicate with it. WebElement interface is a wrapper around real elements on web pages. By class is a wrapper around web element locator, with the help of which WebDriver can locate elements on web page. Read Selenium WebDriver [official documentation](https://selenium.dev/documentation/en/).  

After that complete the following tasks:

1. Create test, which goes to [https://mail.yandex.com/](https://passport.yandex.com/), login with correct credentials (Create account for your test; use Maven as project and build management tool; choose testing framework by yourself). Do not forget to add assertion in your test. You may choose another site to complete this task if yandex portal is not good enough for you due to any reasons. As an option you can use <https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/>](https://magento.softwaretestingboard.com/)

2. Create By variables, which over all possible types of location in Selenium WebDriver (in separate class). It means that you need to call all searching methods from the By class (like By.ClassName, By.XPath etc.) You don't need to use them in your tests, just initialize your By variables in separate class by calling search methods.
